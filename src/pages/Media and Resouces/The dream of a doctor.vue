          The Dream of a Doctor
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In the small town of Naishi-Lare, nestled in the heart of Njoro Sub-
          County, resides an extraordinary individual who has overcome numerous
          obstacles to achieve her dreams. Meet Janet Wanjiku, a young woman
          whose unyielding determination and passion for education have shone
          through even in the face of adversity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Born into a family with limited resources, Janet’s father, a
          hardworking man, struggled to provide for his children’s education
          after losing his job at the flower farm due to the COVID pandemic.
          With two younger siblings in high school and his eldest daughter,
          Janet, offered a spot at KMTC for nursing, the financial burden seemed
          insurmountable. Yet, through the support of relatives and her father’s
          resilience, Janet managed to enrol in high school.

        />
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Throughout her high school journey, Janet encountered various
          challenges, from purchasing uniforms to finding a way to pay her
          school fees. She was lucky to get a sponsor “Baba Njeri” who paid her
          school fees until she sat for her final exams. The support she allowed
          Janet to excel academically and score a remarkable B+ in her form 4
          exams.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Unfortunately, despite her achievements, the lack of financial means
          meant she couldn’t fulfill her dream of joining Masinde Muliro
          University. Undeterred, Janet continued to seek opportunities,
          applying to KMTC multiple times without success. This didn’t dampen
          her spirits; instead, she focused on being a role model for her
          younger sister, Lucy Wanju, and all her siblings, encouraging them to
          study hard and listen to their parents’ guidance.

          As she was waiting for support to join university, she was called back
          to Mugumo High School where she taught biology and chemistry with
          passion. Despite commuting 15 kilometers each day, the little she’s
          gets appreciated with by the school management, she diligently saves
          the money, which she plans to use for her admission to university.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          During home visit to Janet’s place, she narrated to us of her career
          goals and how much she’d want to be a doctor. “If I can’t become a
          doctor,” Janet said, “I’m going to spoonfeed my future child to be a
          doctor.” This were such powerful statements that shows her drive to
          succeed in life.

            Janet Wanjiku is an inspiration to us all. She shows us that anything is possible if we have the determination and resilience to never give up on our dreams. Currently, R.O.C.K Bridge ministries has facilitated her admission at Kenyatta University to pursue a degree in community health nursing.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Janet’s motivation is deeply rooted in her desire to uplift her family
          and break the cycle of poverty. Her resilience, discipline, and hard
          work have earned her respect not only from her parents but also from
          her neighbours and community.
