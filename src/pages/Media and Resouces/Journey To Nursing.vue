          Simon Kingori’s Journey to Nursing: A Story of Determination and Hope
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Simon Kingori is a young man from Kenya who is determined to break the
          cycle of poverty and become a nurse. His journey has not been easy,
          but his determination and passion for helping others have never
          wavered.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Simon was born into a humble background. The first born among four
          others. His father is unreliable and often out of work, and his mother
          is a casual laborer who often works in other peoples’ farms at a daily
          wage of Kshs 200 per day ($1.36) -which is not easily available
          especially during the dry season.

          Simon excelled in school and graduated from high school in the year
          201l where he scored a (B+) but could not enroll to the university.
          Upon realizing that he couldn’t raise the tuition fee, he decided to
          look for a job to support his family and hopefully raise fees to
          further his education. Simon worked odd jobs for several years, but he
          never gave up on his dream of becoming a nurse.

          school by a well-wisher.

          Mr’s Mburu decided to refer the case to ROCK Bridge Ministries for a possible scholarship consideration. RBM decided to do a home visit, which is one of the criteria of selecting beneficiaries, to ascertain the need. It was evident that Simon needed the support to completer the remaining part of his course and help him actualize a 13-year journey of becoming a medic.

          Out of desperation, he opted to sell the medical book to one of the lecturers, Mr’s Mburu. The idea was to raise money to sustain him in school for a certain period and be allowed to sit for external exams. It’s a that point that Mr’s Mburu was curious to know why Simon is selling a very expensive book. Upon inquiring from Simon, she found out that the young man is struggling to raise school fee, take care of his basic needs as well that of his family.
