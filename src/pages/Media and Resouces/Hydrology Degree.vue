          In the heart of Njoro, Nakuru County, a remarkable individual named
          Everlyne Aluso has emerged as a beacon of hope and resilience. Through
          the support of R.O.C.K Bridge Ministries (RBM), Aluso has not only
          realized her dream of pursuing higher education but also secured a
          pivotal role as a site manager for the upcoming holiday homes. Her
          journey is a testament to the resilience, transformative power of
          education and the profound impact of organizations like RBM.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Aluso’s journey with RBM began in 2012 when she was at a form 2.
          Facing financial constraints, she encountered a significant hurdle in
          her pursuit of a university education. Undeterred, she spent two years
          working at a flower farm near her home, Sunripe Flowers, supporting
          her family with her meager earnings of $3 per day. Her determination
          to overcome obstacles and create a brighter future for herself fueled
          her resolve.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-5">
          A Solution for Her Community: Hailing from Kitui, a semi-arid region in Southeastern Kenya University, Aluso experienced firsthand the devastating effects of drought and water scarcity. Motivated by a desire to find sustainable solutions to these challenges, she was inspired to study hydrology. RBM’s scholarship became the catalyst that enabled her to pursue her chosen field of study, leading to her graduation with a Bachelor of Science in Hydrology in 2022.

          Upon completing her studies, Aluso, like many graduates, eagerly awaited job opportunities. After an 8-month wait, RBM reached out to her with an offer to work as a site manager for the holiday homes project. Seizing the opportunity, she embraced her new role, which encompassed various responsibilities such as stock management, supervision, payroll administration, material procurement, and logistics. Thriving in a male-dominated sector, Aluso views her position as both a privilege and an opportunity to break barriers and inspire other women.

The project’s completion will not only generate employment opportunities for the local community but also serve as a demonstration to the lasting change that can be achieved through collective efforts.
