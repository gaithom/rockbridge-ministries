         ROCKbridge Ministries is a Christian multi-denominational non-profit 
         organization that bridges communities in the United States with those in Kenya, 
         allowing a two-way flow of resources and opportunities to empower those communities to meet their 
         spiritual and physical needs with the love of Christ. ROCKbridge reaches out to the city of Nakuru, 
         Kenya through outreach, evangelism, and discipleship programs both independently and through partnerships 
         with local churches.

            ROCKbridge Ministries carries out its mission holistically, using the Gospel as the center from which a
            number of different ministries flow to comprehensively impact every area of a community. The individual 
            ministries ROCKbridge operates and supports are based on the core values of Spiritual Development, Education,

            discipleship, leadership development programs, medical clinics, childrenâ€™s homes, primary and secondary 
            schools, a nursing and trade college, a conference and retreat centre, and much more.
