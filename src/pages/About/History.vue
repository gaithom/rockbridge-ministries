              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Zablon Kuria, formerly employed in the insurance industry and a successful businessman, hails from Nakuru, Kenya. He moved to the United States, where he dedicated 8 years to studying theology at Beulah Bible College while simultaneously serving as a facilities manager at Rosewell Presbyterian Church. After completing his studies, Zablon felt a divine calling to return to Kenya for ministry work. Seeking God's guidance, he contemplated whether to establish a church. However, God led him in a different direction by placing James 1:27 on his heart, instilling a desire to assist orphans and widows in need.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                During his time in the U.S., Zablon developed several relationships with American churches. Collaborating with these churches, he devised a framework to fulfill their collective mission of serving Kenyan communities in the name of Christ. This collaboration resulted in the establishment of R.O.C.K. Bridge Ministries, a non-profit organization, in 2008. R.O.C.K. Bridge was designed to be a fully interdenominational ministry, fostering unity among Christian churches of various denominations to advance the Kingdom of God collaboratively.

                Zablon now serves as the Executive Director of R.O.C.K Bridge Ministries. Through the close following of Biblical principles, accountability, good stewardship of God's provision, and a lot of prayer, R.O.C.K Bridge has grown to have an impact larger than Zablon or any of its founders expected. The orphanage, popularly know as Tumaini Mission Center, owned and managed by P.C.E.A Nakuru West parish, that began with 3 children is now home to over 110 orphans, the primary and secondary schools have grown from 10 students to nearly 600, and over 160 families have benefited from employment associated with the projects R.O.C.K Bridge has helped to start.
